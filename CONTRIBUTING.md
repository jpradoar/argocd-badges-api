### 3. Automatic versioning

This repository uses Semantic Version to generate automatic versions based on commitments, for this reason we will use minimal rules so that everything has coherence.

| feat!: / fix!: / BREAKING CHANGE:        | major)                   |
| chore: / docs: / refactor: / test:       | no changes               |
| feat(api): ... -beta                     | prerelease X.Y.Z-beta    |
| build:                                   | add metadata +sha     	  |
